      <h2>Reasons nets should be banned</h2>
      <h4>1. Fish are cruely fished up in nets onto docks of boats and are left to suffocate, and die a painful death.<br>2. Other animals that aren't fish are fished up in the nets, such as dolphins, and they drown.<br>3. They also are really cruel to animals that get fished up, such as kicking them in the face and dumping them off the boat.<br>4. They also catch endangered fish, which are slowly dying becuase they can't reporduce faster than ships catch them.<br>5. Tying back to number 4, this also damages the ecosystem and can affect the rate of reproduction.</h4>

      <h2>But wait! Fishing provides a lot of food for the world.</h2>
      <h4>While this is true, fishing catches lots of endagered species, and people can't eat the fish that insdustrial ships catch with nets, leading to unused fish being stored, or sometimes thrown away.</h4>

    <h2 style="font-family: courier;">Proposed action</h2>
    <h4>1. Find facts, then build this website and share it on social media.<br>2. Share detailed information (dead animals) to make people feel they should do something about it.<br>3. Launch a website and share it with people.<br>4. Ask for a petition to propose a bill or law.</h4>

      <h2>What we want to acomplish</h2>
      <h4>We want the government to pass a law that bans catching of mammals, such as dolphins, and endangered species, or fishing nets banned entirely in some waters with endangered species. We still need nets for food, but we don't really need as many as we have currently.</h4>
