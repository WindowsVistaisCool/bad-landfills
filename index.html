      <h3>Reasons nets should be banned</h3>
      <h4>1. Fish are cruely fished up in nets onto docks of boats and are left to suffocate, and die a painful death.<br>2. Other animals that aren't fish are fished up in the nets, such as dolphins, and they drown.<br>3. They also are really cruel to animals that get fished up, such as kicking them in the face and dumping them off the boat.<br>4. They also catch endangered fish, which are slowly dying becuase they can't reporduce faster than ships catch them.<br>5. Tying back to number 4, this also damages the ecosystem and can affect the rate of reproduction.</h4>
